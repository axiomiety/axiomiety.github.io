### Writeups ###

I'm a big fan of wargames - they always strike me as a great way to build up know-how and more importantly, just a fun way to learn about new things. Barrier to entry is limited by how much time you can dedicate to the game and not much else. Apart from a shell and an inquisitive mind, there isn't much else required.
