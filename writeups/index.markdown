I'm a big fan of wargames - they always strike me as a great way to build up know-how and more importantly, just a fun way to learn about new things. Barrier to entry is limited by how much time you can dedicate to the game and not much else. Apart from a shell and an inquisitive mind, there isn't much else required.

The below are mainly writeups. They provide a full working solutions, and aren't particularly helpful if you're only looking for hints to point you in the right direction. I am currently experimenting with adding hints using overlays and the ability to toggle writeups - check out [Natas](natas.html) to see what that looks like.
