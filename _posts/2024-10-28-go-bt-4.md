In [part 3]({% post_url 2024-09-25-go-bt-3 %}) we looked at leveraging trackers to obtain a list of peers serving a given torrent. In this post we'll look at connecting to peers and figure out which ones have the blocks we require.

We're building up from the [go-bt](https://github.com/axiomiety/go-bt) repository. Clone it if you want to follow along!

# Peers representation

A tracker returns a list of peers as per the below:

```
/V/r/g/src ❯❯❯ curl -s -X GET 'https://torrent.ubuntu.com/announce?info_hash=A%E6%CDP%CC%ECU%CDW%04%C5%E3%D1v%E7%B5%93%17%A3%FB&peer_id=%FC%93%15%9A%3A%B0as%F2%91%A4-%7F%BE%3A%60%D2l74&port=6688&uploaded=0&downloaded=0&left=0' | go run ./main.go bencode -decode=- | head -20
{
  "complete": 713,
  "incomplete": 26,
  "interval": 1800,
  "peers": [
    {
      "ip": "2607:5300:60:623::1",
      "peer id": "-TR2940-nvogl7ewmfwf",
      "port": 51413
    },
    {
      "ip": "2001:41d0:2:94d1::1",
      "peer id": "-lt0D80-\u0016\ufffdO \u0019ڷ\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd o",
      "port": 6882
    },
    {
      "ip": "2a03:6880:10e7:2a00:c0ab:7cff:febd:274a",
      "peer id": "-TR3000-a0xk5a66l1xz",
      "port": 51413
    },
```

An IP (which could be IPv4 or IPv6) and a port is all we need.

# Establishing a connection to a peer

The connection to a peer is both bidirectional and somewhat asynchronous. It's not simply a case of sending a message and listening for a response - communication from a peer can happen at any time, which is e.g. the case with with the `choke` message. Note that all messages are binary in essence - this is *not* a text-based protocol.

We'll deal with connecting to a peer separately from accepting connections, but the mechanism is similar overall.

## Initating a connection

The steps required before our connection to the peer is "ready" are:
  - establish a TCP connection
  - send a handshake
  - receive a handshake
  - (optionally) send/receive a bitfield
  - ready!

## The Handshake

The handshake message must be the first one being sent upon establishing a connection with a peer, before sending any other kinds of messages, and is of the following format:

{% highlight golang %}
type Handshake struct {
	PstrLen  byte
	Pstr     []byte
	Reserved [8]byte
	InfoHash [20]byte
	PeerId   [20]byte
}
{% highlight golang %}

Here `PstrLen` defines the length (in bytes) of `Pstr`. The 8 `Reserved` bytes are currently all 0, and the rest are essentially details about both ourselves (the `PeerId`) and the torrent we wish to download (`InfoHash`).

Converting a hanshake to bytes over the wire is relatively simple:

{% highlight golang %}
func (h *Handshake) ToBytes() []byte {
	buffer := new(bytes.Buffer)
	buffer.WriteByte(h.PstrLen)
	buffer.Write(h.Pstr)
	buffer.Write(h.Reserved[:])
	buffer.Write(h.InfoHash[:])
	buffer.Write(h.PeerId[:])
	return buffer.Bytes()
}
{% endhighlight %}

A handshake is both sent and received, but sent first by the client establishing the connection. For one, the `InfoHash` needs to match. And if the `PeerId` received is different from the one that was sent out, we're free to drop the connection (we would have received the `PeerId` and its connection details from the tracker, so it's odd that somehow the `PeerId` would have changed). The reverse is also true - if the `InfoHash` we send out doesn't match a torrent served by the peer we're trying to connect to, they're free to drop it.

Once all details match we can say we are properly "connected" to the peer and we can start exchanging messages!

## Putting it all together

So this gets a little funky and there's a bit of scaffholding involved. 


# Message formats

The message format used by the BitTorrent protocol is length-prefixed and generally defined as such:

```
length of the message # 4 bytes
message id # 1 byte
payload # could be empty!
```

The only exception to this is the `keep-alive` message which doesn't have a message ID - it's just `0x00 0x00` as the length (it's a special case when we serialise it out - sigh).

We model this as such:

{% highlight golang %}
type Message struct {
	Length    [4]byte
	MessageId byte
	Payload   []byte
}

func (m *Message) ToBytes() []byte {
	buffer := new(bytes.Buffer)
	buffer.Write(m.Length[:])
	// handle the special keep-alive case
	if m.Length == [4]byte{0, 0, 0, 0} {
		return buffer.Bytes()
	}
	buffer.WriteByte(m.MessageId)
	buffer.Write(m.Payload)
	return buffer.Bytes()
}
{% endhighlight %}


We'll only look at 2 messages in this post and leave the rest for the next one.

## Keep-alive

This message has length set to zero and must be sent periodically to a peer if we want to maintain a connection despite not communication with said peer (perhaps it doesn't have any of the blocks we're interested in).

## Bitfield

This message enables us to find out which blocks are available from the given peer (and for the peer to find out which blocks are available from us). The format of the `bitfield` message is as follows:
```
<len=0001+len(bitfield)> # in bytes
<id=5>
<bitfield>
```

Let's work through an example. Suppose our torrent has 12 blocks - that would require a bitfield of 12 bits, which is 2 bytes. If all blocks were available we would send a total of 7 bytes. 4 for the length (that's predefined in the spec), 1 for the message ID, and 2 for the bitfield (we can't send 12 bits so we round this up to the next power of 2):
```
3 # 1 + 2 bytes, stored as 4 bytes
5 # the message id
0xff 0xf0 # unused bits are set to 0
```

If instead we were missing the first block, the bitfield would be `0x7f 0xf0` (`0x7f` is `0b01111111`).

Here's a live example - here the peer is telling us that *all* blocks are available:
```
```
