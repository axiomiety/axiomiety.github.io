So it'd be great to say we're done - but there are still a couple of things to iron out.

# Test ROM

The [test ROM](https://github.com/corax89/chip8-test-rom) by `corax89` is really handy - when run it will validate instructions and assuming you have the `disp` instruction working (`0xdxyn`) it will output one of `ok` or `no` for each instruction type.

I took it for a spin and was greeted by 3 things. The first was that it completed before I could make any sense of what happened - so I added a `SDL_Delay(200);` after each iteration to slow things down (told you that timing thing would come back to haunt us...). The second was that every status code is displayed in the middle of the screen instead of in a grid format (woops). The third was a bunch of `no` statuses for my "set register to register" and subtraction operations:

A quick glance at the code showed that I had swapped registers `x` and `y` around:

```

For subtraction I messed up the `mod 255` operation:

```

Fixing those and running the test ROM again gave me the all clear. But I couldn't readily tell what was wrong with the display.

# Fixing the display

## Controlling execution

One thing that I wanted was the ability to suspend execution - to be able to log some of the state (e.g. dump the registers, show the memory, ...), and resume/step through instructions. So I changed the main loop to this such that pressing space would suspend/resume execution, and pressing return would step through the next instruction (before suspending again).

{% highlight c %}
    bool running = true;
    bool step = false;
    while (!state.quit)
    {
        if (running || step)
        {
            processOp(&state, memory);
            if (state.draw)
            {
                updateScreen(renderer, texture, memory, pixels);
                state.draw = false;
            }
            processInput(&state, keyStates);

            step = false;
        }
        if (keyStates[SDL_SCANCODE_SPACE])
        {
            SDL_Log("Pause toggled");
            // so we don't untoggle too fast
            SDL_Delay(1000);
            running = running ? false : true;
        }
        if (keyStates[SDL_SCANCODE_RETURN])
        {
            SDL_Log("Stepping through");
            step = true;
        }
        // more for quit than anything else?
        while (SDL_PollEvent(&event))
        {
            processEvent(&state, &event);
        }
        SDL_Delay(100);
    }
{% endhighlight %}

We can see that working through the logs:

```

```

## Animating a sprite

The aim here is to write a small ROM (in assembly) that animates a sprite. This will hopefully show us what we might be doing wrong.

Picking the right sprite was the hardest bit. Thankfully there are free tools like [pixilart](https://www.pixilart.com/draw) that make this easy. I'm not much of an artist but this looked alien-like enough for me. Note the use of an *asymmetric* pattern to catch bit-flipping:

```
 #    #   01000010
  #  # #  00100101
 ######   01111110
## ## ##  11011011
########  11111111
 ######   01111110
  #  #    00100100
  ####    00111100
```

As I started to look through this I realised I made 2 mistakes. The first is that I took `x,y` to be absolute coordinates whereas the specs specify those are *registers* - that's the easy fix. The second mistake was to assume you always wrote pixels at 8-bit boundaries. Consider the top row of the sprite:

```
Step 1 - (0,0): 0100000010 (0,8): 00000000
Step 2 - (0,0): 0010000001 (0,8): 00000000
Step 3 - (0,0): 0001000000 (0,8): 10000000
```

Shifting the bit pattern doesn't happen in multiples of 8. If we update a pattern at `(0,3)` it will cause 2 memory addresses to change:
```
Current pixels: (0,0): 01100111 (0,8): 01100001
New pixels:     (0,0):    10100 (0,8): 110
End result:     (0,0): 01110100 (0,8): 11000001
```

Now because this implementation stores the state of the pixels in memory, we store them in groups of 8 bits - so updating pixels at places other than boundaries is a little trickier. I tried my hand at doing this but I couldn't justify the complexity of the code (also, whilst it *appeared* to work, I couldn't convince myself it was correct).

Pragmatism took over - instead of relying on writing the display to the "main" memory I added a `bool` array representing the state of each pixel to the state:

{% highlight c %}
    bool pixels[SCREEN_WIDTH*SCREEN_HEIGHT];
{% endhighlight %}

Meaning that my `setPixel` implementation was condensed to about 15 lines instead of the monstruosity it was before:

{% highlight c %}
void setPixels(State *state, uint8_t xReg, uint8_t yReg, uint8_t height, uint8_t memory[])
{
    state->registers[0xf] = 0;
    for (int h=0; h<height;h++) {
        uint8_t y = (state->registers[yReg] + h) % SCREEN_HEIGHT;
        uint8_t sprite = memory[state->i+h];
        for (int shift=7;shift>=0;shift--) {
            uint8_t x = (state->registers[xReg] + 7-shift) % SCREEN_WIDTH;
            uint8_t bit = (sprite >> shift) & 0x1;
            state->registers[0xf] |= state->pixels[x+y*SCREEN_WIDTH] & bit;
            state->pixels[x+y*SCREEN_WIDTH] ^= bit;
        }
    }
    state->draw = true;
    state->pc += 2;
}
{% endhighlight %}

Whilst doing this I also re-read [the original Byte magazine CHIP-8 instructions](https://archive.org/details/byte-magazine-1978-12/page/n113/mode/2up?view=theater) to sort out how the `0xf` register gets set (hint - it's when you try to turn on a pixel that is already on, not when you change the state of a pixel, meaning it's actually different from the `draw` flag!).

The following test ROM will slide the alien's face down the screen every second (based on the timer):
```
        0xa2, 0x04, // set i to x204
        0x12, 0x0c, // jump to the start of the program
        0x42, 0x24, // alien sprite start
        0x7e, 0xdb,
        0xff, 0x7e,
        0x24, 0x3c, // alien sprite end
        0x61, 0x0,  // r1=0
        0x62, 0x0,  // r2=0
        0x0, 0xe0,  // DISP: clear display
        0xd1, 0x28, // display sprite
        0x71, 0x01, // r1 += 1
        0x72, 0x01, // r2 += 1
        0x65, 0x3c, // r5 = 60
        0xf5, 0x15, // set the timer to r5
        0xf5, 0x07, // CHECK_TIMER: r5 = delay timer value
        0x35, 0x00, // if r5 (the timer value) is 0, skip the next instructions
        0x12, 0x1c, // jump back to CHECK_TIMER
        0x12, 0x10, // jump back to DISP
```

Once satisfied it worked, re-running the test ROM gives the expected output:

Success!

# Input capture

It turns out there's a much simpler way of capture input. 

# Timers & timings

I left this till the end because... I wasn't sure how I wanted to deal with it. After some (light) reading, I think the approach below should do the trick.

To start, let's note that CHIP-8 timers (both the delay and the sound) run at 60Hz - this roughly translates to a tick every 0.0167 seconds. In other words, the timers should be decremented every 0.0167 seconds.

Leaving that aside, how many opcodes should we process per time step? The answer is a bit more complicated in that it really is "as many as we can but no more than". The CHIP-8 virtual CPU runs at around 500Hz, or 500 cycles per second. We can make the assumption that each opcode takes one cycle to process (it doesn't really - some might take more where e.g. memory access is required).

Combining both together, the pseudo-code for the loop goes like this:

```
clockSpeed = 500
timerDelta = 1/60.0
accumulator = 0
currTime = now()
while (running)
{
  newNow = now()
  elapsedTime = newNow - currTime
  numCycles = int(elapsedTime*clockSpeed)
  if (numCycles > 1)
  {
    currTime = newNow
    timePerCycle = elapsedTime/numCycles
    while (numCycles > 1)
    {
      procesInput
      processOp
      updateDisplay
      accumulator += timePerCycle
      while (accumulator > timerDelta)
      {
        if (delayTimer > 0) delayTimer -= 1
        if (soundTimer > 0) soundTimer -= 1
        accumulator -= timerDelta
      }
      maybeDelayIfTooFast
    }
  }
}
```

This places a lower bound on the execution - if we process operations faster than 500Hz (500 cycles per second), we'll just wait until enough time has elapsed that we need to process something. Spoiler alert, this is exactly what happened when I tried this on my moderately modern laptop. It would execute a handful of cycles super fast and then wait till it accumulated enough "ticks" to process some instructions. This gave games a very noticeable stop/start delay. The solution was to add a fixed delay after each cycle of `timePerCycle`. If anything I was wondering whether I was going too slow - but this clearly wasn't the case.

The implementation is practically the same as the pseudo-code:

{% highlight c %}
    while (!state.quit)
    {
        newTick = SDL_GetTicks();
        elapsedTicks = newTick - currTick;
        numCycles = elapsedTicks / 1000 * clockSpeed;
        totalCycles += numCycles;
        if (numCycles > 0)
        {
            currTick = newTick;
            timePerCycle = elapsedTicks / numCycles;
            while (numCycles > 1)
            {

                SDL_PumpEvents(); // this is needed to populate the keyboard state array
                processInput(&state, keyStates);
                processOp(&state, memory);
                accumulator += timePerCycle;
                if (keyStates[SDL_SCANCODE_SPACE])
                {
                    SDL_Log("Space pressed, will exit");
                    state.quit = true;
                    break;
                }
                if (state.draw)
                {
                    updateScreen2(renderer, texture, state.pixels, pixels);
                    state.draw = false;
                }
                while (accumulator > timerDelta)
                {
                    if (state.delay_timer > 0)
                        state.delay_timer--;
                    if (state.sound_timer > 0)
                        state.sound_timer--;
                    accumulator -= timerDelta;
                }
                numCycles--;
                SDL_Delay(timePerCycle);
            }
        }
    }
{% endhighlight %}

Any pause/stepping code was removed for clarity.
