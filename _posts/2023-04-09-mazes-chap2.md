# A bit-field grid

As it stands, the current implementation of `Grid` is a 2-dimentional array of cells - where each cell maintains a list of its neighbours and which ones it links to. This is very flexible and can support one-way passages, but much more than what we require for implementing `BinaryTree`.

## `BinaryTree` 

Quick recap on the `BinaryTree` algorithm:

 1. pick a cell
 2. create a passage between *one* of north, east (whichever ones are valid)
 3. repeat for each unvisited cell

Two things to note:
 - we can iterate over each cell one-by-bone
 - we keep track of whether a cell is linked either of 2 directions (`:north`, `:east`)

## `BitfieldGrid`

_Note_: instead of `:north`, I find using `:south` easier to follow given we'll start iterating from the top-left corner.

If you read this a little too quick, you might have read this as a "bit" grid - but we need at least 3 values to figure out which neighbours a cell is connected to. We can do this with 2 bits!
 - `0x00`: no passageways to `:south`,`:east`
 - `0x01`: passageway to the `:east`
 - `0x10`: passageway to the `:south`

Let's start by inheriting from `Grid` and storing integers (not `Cell`s) in our 2D `Array`s.

{% highlight ruby %}
class BitfieldGrid < Grid
    attr_reader :rows, :columns

    def initialize(rows, columns)
        @rows = rows
        @columns = columns
        @grid = prepare_grid
    end

    def prepare_grid
        Array.new(@rows) do |row|
            Array.new(@columns) do |column|
                0
            end
        end
    end
end
{% endhighlight %}

We already inherit the `[](row, col)` getter from `Grid`, but we need a setter:


{% highlight ruby %}
    def []=(row, column, val)
        @grid[row][column] = val
    end
{% endhighlight %}

When displaying the grid, just like the original implementation, we only need to know if it has a `:south` passageway or an `:east` one.

_Note_: not being familiar with trusty/falsy values in Ruby was a bit of a gotcha here - hence the explicit `==` in the code:
```
irb(main):034:0> 0 ? "0 is true" : "0 is false"
=> "0 is true"
```

We can just cycle through each cell, left to right, top-down:

{% highlight ruby %}
    def to_s
        output = "+" + "---+" * columns + "\n"

        (0..@rows-1).each do |row_idx|
            top = "|"
            bottom = "+"

            @grid[row_idx].each_index do |col_idx|
                body = "   "
                cell = self[row_idx,col_idx]
                east_boundary = (cell & 0x1 == 0x1) ? " " : "|"
                top << body << east_boundary
                
                south_bounary = (cell & 0x10 == 0x10) ? "   " : "---"
                corner = "+"
                bottom << south_bounary << corner
            end

            output << top << "\n"
            output << bottom << "\n"
        end

        output
    end
{% endhighlight %}

## `BinaryTree.onBitfieldGrid`

For this we'll mirror the current implementation:

{% highlight ruby %}
    def self.on(grid)
        grid.each_cell do |cell|
            neighbors = []

            neighbors << cell.north if cell.north
            neighbors << cell.east if cell.east

            neighbor = neighbors.sample
            cell.link(neighbor) if neighbor
        end
    end
{% endhighlight %}

Our new `onBitGrid` method looks like this:

{% highlight ruby %}
    def self.onBitGrid(grid)
        grid.each_cell do |row_idx, col_idx|
            neighbors = []
            neighbors << :south if grid[row_idx+1,col_idx]
            neighbors << :east if grid[row_idx,col_idx+1]

            neighbor = neighbors.sample
            if neighbor == :south
                grid[row_idx,col_idx] = 0x10
            elsif neighbor == :east
                grid[row_idx,col_idx] = 0x1
            end
        end
    end
{% endhighlight %}

The only real difference is that instead of linking cells, we store the "link" value described above.

## Validation

Let's apply `BinaryTree` first to a normal grid, and then a bit-field one:


{% highlight ruby %}
grid = BitfieldGrid.new(10,10)
BinaryTree.onBitGrid(grid)
puts grid
grid2 = Grid.new(10,10)
BinaryTree.on(grid2)
puts grid2
{% endhighlight %}

```

Yay! They look pretty much identical in structure and we're *done*. Almost.

## Metrics

After all this (hard?) work, let's try to understand how much we saved in terms of (1) memory and (2) CPU.
