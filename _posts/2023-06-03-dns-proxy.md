I recently picked up a copy of [Black Hat Go](https://nostarch.com/blackhatgo) which touched upon something I've been wanting to do for a while - namely a DNS proxy that logs DNS requests and sinkholes certain domains, particularly pertaining to adverts or tracking. Now a fair bunch can be done via Browser plugins but with e.g. a phone app, router, internet-enabled device, you're better off setting up your own DNS. I'm fully aware there's already stuff out there that does this but I've been meaning to get back into `golang` and this felt like a great opportunity.

We'll focus on functionality first before adding the bells and whilstles later.

# Transparent proxy

For this to be any use we'll first want to transparently relay our requests to a DNS server of our choice (e.g. Google's `8.8.8.8`). For this we'll use the excellent [dns](https://www.github.com/miekg/dns) package.

The POC looks like this:

{% highlight golang %}
package main

import (
	"github.com/miekg/dns"
	"log"
)

func main() {
	var serverAddr = "8.8.8.8:53"
	dns.HandleFunc(".", func(w dns.ResponseWriter, req *dns.Msg) {
		log.Printf("%+v\n",req)
		resp, err := dns.Exchange(req, serverAddr)
		if err != nil {
			dns.HandleFailed(w, req)
			return
		}
		if err := w.WriteMsg(resp); err != nil {
			dns.HandleFailed(w, req)
			return
		}

	})
	log.Fatal(dns.ListenAndServe(":53", "udp", nil))
}
{% endhighlight %}

`go run` the above, and let's use `dig` to query:

```
❯ dig +noall +answer facebook.com
facebook.com.           279     IN      A       157.240.13.35
❯ dig @localhost +noall +answer facebook.com
facebook.com.           275     IN      A       157.240.235.35
❯ dig @localhost +noall +answer facebook.com
facebook.com.           22      IN      A       157.240.15.35
```

There's some load-balancing going on here but we're looking at IPs in the same subnet so we must be doing something right.

# Sinkhole

Right now we're forwarding clients requests to a *real* DNS - but we also want the ability to sinkhole certain domains. Let's start by writing this as a function. Note that a single DNS request can contain many questions, so we need to check all.

{% highlight golang %}
func localproxy(w dns.ResponseWriter, req *dns.Msg) {
	var resp dns.Msg
	resp.SetReply(req)
	for _, q := range req.Question {
		log.Printf("sinkholing req for %s", q.Name)
		a := dns.A{
			Hdr: dns.RR_Header{
				Name:   q.Name,
				Rrtype: dns.TypeA,
				Class:  dns.ClassINET,
				Ttl:    60,
			},
			A: net.ParseIP("127.0.0.1").To4(),
		}
		resp.Answer = append(resp.Answer, &a)
	}
	w.WriteMsg(&resp)
}
{% endhighlight %}

The target IP could be anything but `localhost` has a nice ring to it.

Extracting the forwarding logic into its own `forward` `func`, we can rewrite `main` as:

{% highlight golang %}
func main() {

	dns.HandleFunc("facebook.com", forward)
	dns.HandleFunc("abc.facebook.com", localproxy)
	log.Fatal(dns.ListenAndServe(":53", "udp", nil))
}
{% endhighlight %}

Note that the order in which we define those `HandleFunc` will respect the domain hierarchy (as in the ordering doesn't matter - the most-specific match is tried first before bubbling up to the top-level domain).

# Config, hot reload and command-line flags

With the above we have the basic functionality down - but there's more we can do to make this user-friendly and packageable. At the very least we'll want to:
  - write to a file a list of all the domains requested that were proxied transparently (for review)
  - pass in the name of a file containing a list of sinkholed domains
  - make the above cmdline flags, as well as specifying which DNS to forward requests to

## List of sinkholed domains

The `dns` package has a `HandleRemove` method - meaning that as long as we keep track of what gets added we should able to remove them.

To get this going we'll need to kick off `dns.ListenAndServe` in its own `goroutine`, and ditto for our signal handlers (we have one for `Ctrl-C` essentially, and one for `SIGHUP` that triggers the reload):

{% highlight golang %}
    go func() {
		log.Fatal(dns.ListenAndServe(":53", "udp", nil))
	}()

	sigsStop := make(chan os.Signal, 1)
	signal.Notify(sigsStop, syscall.SIGINT, syscall.SIGTERM)
	sigHup := make(chan os.Signal, 1)
	signal.Notify(sigHup, syscall.SIGHUP)
	done := make(chan bool, 1)

	go func() {
        reload()
		for {
			<-sigHup
			reload()
		}
	}()

	go func() {
		<-sigsStop
		log.Printf("shutting down")
		done <- true
	}()

	<-done
{% endhighlight %}

where `reload`, for now, can be as simple as what we had before:

{% highlight golang %}
func reload() {
    log.Printf("reload called\n")
	dns.HandleFunc(".", forward)
	dns.HandleFunc("facebook.com", forward)
	dns.HandleFunc("abc.facebook.com", localproxy)
}
{% endhighlight %}

Let's make sure this works by sending `kill -HUP 72149` once it's up:

```
2023/06/02 21:00:21 PID: 72149
2023/06/02 21:00:21 reload called
2023/06/02 21:00:40 reload called
```

Let's now add the bit that reads from a file!

We start by creating a struct that will hold 2 things - a filename (ideally passed in) and a list of domains. The latter is important because we'll want to clear our mapping on reload. To be fair we could just look at the delta between what we have and add/remove accordingly, but that's another "exercise for the interested reader".

{% highlight golang %}
type holder struct {
	Filename string
	Domains []string
}
{% endhighlight %}

We'll change `reload` to operate on `holder`:

{% highlight golang %}
func (data *holder) reload() {
	// remove everything we currently have
	for _, domain := range data.Domains {
		dns.HandleRemove(domain)
	}

	// forward everything by default
	dns.HandleFunc(".", forward)

	readFile, err := os.Open(data.Filename)
	defer readFile.Close()

	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}

	fileScanner := bufio.NewScanner(readFile)
	fileScanner.Split(bufio.ScanLines)

	for fileScanner.Scan() {
		domain := fileScanner.Text()
		dns.HandleFunc(domain, localproxy)
		data.Domains = append(data.Domains, domain)
	}
	log.Printf("reloaded %d domains", len(data.Domains))
}
{% endhighlight %}

And in our `func main` we simply create the struct up front:

{% highlight golang %}
	data := holder{Filename: "domains.txt"}
	go func() {
		data.reload()
		for {
			<-sigHup
			data.reload()
		}
	}()
{% endhighlight %}

With `domains.txt` being in your *local* directory (the one you invoke the proxy from), containing an entry per line:
```
❯ cat domains.txt
abc.facebook.com
def.facebook.com
```

To validate this, let's start with an empty `domains.txt`, overwrite it with the above and issue a `SIGHUP`. The proxy's logs look good after the reload:

```
2023/06/03 09:20:21 PID: 77484
2023/06/03 09:20:21 reloaded 0 domains
2023/06/03 09:20:44 reloaded 2 domains
```

And testing with `dig`, we're DTRT:
```
❯ dig @localhost +noall +answer abc.facebook.com
abc.facebook.com.       10      IN      A       127.0.0.1
```

Now if you're wondering "but but... locking!", `dns` got your covered. Calls like `HandleRemove` do this on our behalf so we can add and remove as we wish:

{% highlight golang %}
	mux.m.Lock()
	delete(mux.z, CanonicalName(pattern))
	mux.m.Unlock()
{% endhighlight %}

See [here](https://github.com/miekg/dns/blob/master/serve_mux.go) for source.

## Log

The logging we have thus far works, but we can be smarter about it. One potential improvement would be to keep a tally of domains that were queried and automatically match those against say, a list of known bad domains (Domain Block List, perhaps like the one provided by Spamhaus). But in order to do this we don't want to have to parse logs with fancy regular expressions. Instead we should use structured logging.

Witht his in mind, let's use `slog`. Run `go get golang.org/x/exp/slog` to install, and off we go.

Let's start by creating a module-level var - I'm guessing this isn't idomatic `golang` but given I don't use the language I'll pass it as a beginner's mistake (#betterbeatsperfect):

{% highlight golang %}
var logger = slog.New(slog.NewJSONHandler(os.Stdout, nil))
{% endhighlight %}

And we can replace all `log.Printf` calls with something like `logger.Info("config reloaded",  "domains", len(data.Domains))`

Running for good measure:

```
{"time":"2023-06-04T15:37:31.162318+08:00","level":"INFO","msg":"starting","pid":29735}
{"time":"2023-06-04T15:37:31.16557+08:00","level":"INFO","msg":"config reloaded","domains":2}
{"time":"2023-06-04T15:37:40.248166+08:00","level":"INFO","msg":"sinkhole request","domain":"abc.facebook.com."}
{"time":"2023-06-04T15:37:50.937524+08:00","level":"INFO","msg":"forward req","domain":"stackoverflow.com."}
```

It's a bit overkill but if you had say, `logstash` set up to publish this to `ElasticSearch`, you'd have a field day.

## Flags

For the final bells and whistles! We have hard-coded both the list of domains *and* the DNS we wish to forward to. Let's change that:

{% highlight golang %}
	serverAddr := flag.String("dns","8.8.8.8:53","<ip>:<port>")
	domains := flag.String("domains","domains.txt","file containing a list of domains to sinkhole, one per line")
{% endhighlight %}

The code is available in all its ~~glory~~shame on [GitHub](https://github.com/axiomiety/crashburn/blob/master/blackhatgo/chap05/mydnsproxy/main.go).

# Taking it further

As I was writing this, I realised that maybe it might make more sense to have this the other way around - sinkhole *everything* and only allow-list what is really needed. This is "left as an exercise to the reader" (it should be a case of swapping the `forward` and `localproxy` functions).

Also returning a dummy record for sinkholed domains isn't quite enough as the client will likely try to make a connection. We can spin up a local web server that returns... nothing. This will ensure the connection from the client gets closed quickly and doesn't hang around forever (or whatever timeout the client is set to).
