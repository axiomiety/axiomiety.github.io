This post follows the [Mazes for Programmers](https://pragprog.com/titles/jbmaze/mazes-for-programmers/) book - if you haven't gone through the book/written the suggested code, you can find the required sources on this page.

_Note_: you'll need to have gone through Chapter 2 for the code - those are the exercises at the *end* of Chapter 1, but it only really makes sense to implement them once you have completed Chapter 2 (so you can visualise the changes)

_Note 2_: I don't use `ruby` much, if at all. If there's a more idiomatic way to do something, let me know!

# `BinaryTree` 

This is (roughly) the code you should have by the end of Chapter 2:

{% highlight ruby %}
class BinaryTree
    def self.on(grid)
        grid.each_cell do |cell|
            neighbors = []

            neighbors << cell.north if cell.north
            neighbors << cell.east if cell.east

            neighbor = neighbors.sample
            cell.link(neighbor) if neighbor
        end
    end
end
{% endhighlight %}

And it generates mazes like:

```

|   |           |       |       |   |           |

|   |           |   |           |           |   |
+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
```

## Reorient the Passages

The logic selecting passages to link together is hard-coded in the tree itself - namely:

{% highlight ruby %}
            neighbors = []

            neighbors << cell.north if cell.north
            neighbors << cell.east if cell.east

            neighbor = neighbors.sample
            cell.link(neighbor) if neighbor
{% endhighlight %}

Let's start by abstracting that away such that we take a variable number of biases. On a square grid the options are limited but if we had something hexagonal, you can see how it scale:

{% highlight ruby %}
class BinaryTreeWithBias
    attr_reader :biases
    def initialize(*biases)
        @biases = biases.to_a
    end

    def on(grid)
        grid.each_cell do |cell|
            neighbors = []
            @biases.each do |bias|
                neighbors << cell.public_send(bias) if defined? cell.public_send(bias)
            end

            neighbor = neighbors.sample
            cell.link(neighbor) if neighbor
        end
    end
end
{% endhighlight %}

Side note, see the use of `public_send` - it's one of those things that show `ruby`'s roots in `oop` languages like `smalltalk`.

Just for kicks, let's create a tree with `:north` and `:south` biases:

{% highlight ruby %}
grid = Grid.new(12,12)
BinaryTreeWithBias.new(:north, :south).on(grid)
{% endhighlight %}

yielding:
```

+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
```

## Changing the Bias

How do we bias our `BinaryTree` towards maybe more horizontal or vertical pages? As it stands we sample the biases with uniform probability. That is, if the choice is between `:north` and `:east`, both are equally likely to be chosen.

Let's try assigning weights to each bias - for instance, we may want the likelihood of a passage extending vertically to be twice as much as horizontally. We could represent this as `{:north => 2, :east => 1}`.

Sampling because a case of (1) generating a random number with 0 <-> total weight (3 in the above) and (2) building the relevant intervals (so here, `[0-2] => :north` and `(2-3] => :east`). Depending on where the sample falls within that range, it will dictate the direction we take.

I didn't find an elegant way to do a running sum, but we can be explicit:

{% highlight ruby %}
class BinaryTreeWithBiasAndWeights 
    attr_reader :weights, :biases

    def initialize(direction_to_weights)
        @weights = direction_to_weights
        @biases = @weights.keys
    end

    def on(grid)
        grid.each_cell do |cell|
            neighbors = {}
            @biases.each do |bias|
                neighbors[bias] = cell.public_send(bias) if defined? cell.public_send(bias)
            end

            # do a weighted sample
            running_sum = 0
            biases_boundaries = []
            @biases.each do |bias|
                running_sum += @weights[bias]
                biases_boundaries << running_sum
            end

            total_weights = @biases.map { |bias| @weights[bias]}.sum()
            selection = rand(total_weights+1) # because rand doesn't include the max
            neighbor = neighbors[@biases[biases_boundaries.bsearch_index{|elem| elem >= selection}]]
            cell.link(neighbor) if neighbor
        end
    end
end
{% endhighlight %}

Running it:

{% highlight ruby %}
grid = Grid.new(12,12)
BinaryTreeWithBiasAndWeights.new({:north =>2, :east => 1}).on(grid)
{% endhighlight %}

and there we have it:
