Dumping ground for some bits and bobs regarding Korean and 한글.

This won't be of much help if you don't have a rudimentary understanding of Hangul (the Korean writing system). To be fair it should probably one of the first thing you learn - if only because romanisation doesn't seem to make Korean any favours. It's phonetic and relatively simple to learn (really!). Now being able to pronounce syllables doesn't mean words will be pronounced right, but you'll be more than half-way there.

Example - I ate a dog, a dog ate me (swap the markers?) @italki

### Location
안 = inside
위 = on top
밑 = below
옆 = beside

여기 = here

I'm in dire need of some mnemonics...

## Counters
개 = counter for things
명 = counter for people
번 = counter for behaviors/actions (how many times something was done - like watching a movie)

The (native) numbers 1, 2, 3, 4 and 20 change when adding a counter:
1 = 하나 -> 한
2 = 둘 -> 두
3 = 셋 -> 세
4 = 넷 -> 네
20 = 스물 -> 스무
