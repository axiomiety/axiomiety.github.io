Learning Log

## Languages ##

I have a thing for languages. I only speak French and English fluently but I have high hopes to expand on that.

### Bites

#### 1505 | Secretarial Problem

Source: Polls, nuns and life partners 01 May 15

It's an interesting theory but it's not without caveats. Take interviews for instance - if the pool of eligible candidates was 20 the theory suggests that in order for us to find the *best* candidate, we interview (and reject) the first $$\frac{20}{e}$$ (~7), and then take the first one above the average. Without going into the whole issue with measuring candidates objectively and rating one against the other, what happens if you were among the first 7? Heh...

Not that it's much better but if we instead we focus on maximising the probablity of finding someone 'decent', we should only reject the first $$\sqrt{20}$$ (~4).
