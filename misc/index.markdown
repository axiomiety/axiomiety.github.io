### CCNA Notes ###

I am thinking about taking the CCNA exam so I started drawing up some notes. Here are some of my notes/mindmaps:

 * <a href="http://www.mindmup.com/map/a198cf0740db7f0130957a7a2d07b81bd2" data-role="mindmup-embed" title="Ethernet LANs" data-width="90%" data-height="500" data-style="border:1px solid black;margin-bottom:5px;">Ethernet LANs</a>

MindMup is a really cool tool. Highly recommended.

### Proxy ###

I run an ssh tunneling service for `http` and `https` _only_. Get in touch if you'd like access. Please note that this service is currently offered on a pro-bono basis. I reserve the right to terminate access at any time for whatever reason I deem appropriate. The idea is to allow you to feel somewhat more secure about using public WiFi services (eg from an airport, hotel, cafe, ...).

I am looking at adding an exit point in North America and potentially one in France (though Asia would be great).

### Matasano Crypto Challenge ###

Currently on set 3 - finished the 17th problem. The terms of the challenge prohibit me from sharing solutions/doing write-ups but I'd like to expand on some of the topics covered at some point. Take a look at `crypto_utils` in my [crashburn repo](http://www.github.com/axiomiety)

### Code ###

You can find me on [github](http://www.github.com/axiomiety).
