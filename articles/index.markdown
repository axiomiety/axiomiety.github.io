I often find trying to explain a topic is one of the best way to learn about it. Here are some things I wanted to learn about, and the notes I made in the process.

### Python ###

I primarily code in Python. It's fun, readable, and the possibilities are endless!

  - [`with` statement](code_python-with.html)

### Misc ###

Random stuff I found of interest

  - [Doom Engine](code_doom-engine.html)
    I first came across those while scanning through the source code for [doom](http://www.github.com/id). It highlights some of the technical limitations at the time, and how people got around them.
