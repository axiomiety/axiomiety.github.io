I often find trying to explain a topic is one of the best way to learn about it. Here are some things I wanted to learn about, and the notes I made in the process.

### Python ###

I primarily code in Python. It's fun, readable, and the possibilities are endless!

*   [`with` statement](code_python-with.html)
*   [debugging from the interpreter](code_python-debug.html)

### Tech ###

Random tech-related stuff I found of interest.

*   [Doom Engine](code_doom-engine.html):
    I first came across those while scanning through the source code for [doom](http://www.github.com/id). It highlights some of the technical limitations at the time, and how people got around them.
*   [AWS Glacier](proj_aws-glacier.html):
    A quick introduction to Amazon's Glacier service.
*   [Snake in JS](gaming_snake.html):
    __In progress__ A quick introduction to the 'gaming loop' by building a snake clone using JavaScript

### Finance ###

I currently work in the Finance Industry and here are some rough bits and pieces.

*   [FX Forward](finance_fx-forward.html)
