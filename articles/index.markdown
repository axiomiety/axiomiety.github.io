I often find trying to explain a topic is one of the best way to learn about it. Here are some things I wanted to learn about, and the notes I made in the process.

### Python ###

I primarily code in Python. It's fun, readable, and the possibilities are endless!

*   [`with` statement](code_python-with.html)
*   [debugging from the interpreter](code_python-debug.html)

### Tech ###

Random tech-related stuff I found of interest and wrote about.

*   [Doom Engine](code_doom-engine.html):
    I first came across those while scanning through the source code for [doom](http://www.github.com/id). It highlights some of the technical limitations at the time, and how people got around them.
*   [AWS Glacier](proj_aws-glacier.html):
    A quick introduction to Amazon's Glacier service.
*   [Snake in JS](gaming_snake.html):
    A quick introduction to the critical 'gaming loop' by building a snake clone using JavaScript.
*   [FreeBSD 9.1 on a budget VPS](misc_freebsd-vm128.html):
    FreeBSD is a great OS - but getting this installed on a KVM VPS with 128MB of RAM wasn't as straightforward as I expected.
*   [OpenWRT on a TP-WR710N](misc_openwrt-wr710n.html):
    Wireless freedom!
*   [Wireless (in)Security](misc_wireless_insecurity.html):
    Fun with MAC filtering, hidden SSID and WEP.
*   [Getting started with J](code_j-intro.html):
    J is a programming language with roots in the likes of APL

<!-- this needs further editing and should probably live in the misc section!

### Non-technical ###

*   [Singapore vs United Kingdom](misc_sg_vs_uk.html):
    I relocated to Singapore from the UK. How certain things (banking/mobile/transport/...) differ.
*   [Languages](lang_all.html):
    Not the programming kind.
*   [Fitness events](misc_fitness-events.html):
    Fitness events I participated in, with some tips for people thinking of joining up.
*   [FX Forward](finance_fx-forward.html):
    Because a colleague asked me and I couldn't give a satisfying answer. Though I'm not sure that one is satisfying either!
