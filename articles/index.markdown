I often find trying to explain a topic is one of the best way to learn about it. Here are some things I wanted to learn about, and the notes I made in the process. Newer items are at the top of each section.

### Python ###

I primarily code in Python. It's fun, readable, and the possibilities are endless!

*   [debugging from the interpreter](code_python-debug.html)
*   [`with` statement](code_python-with.html)

### Misc ###

Random stuff I found of interest and wrote about.

    Using D3.js to visualise random walks
*   [A quick intro to Vagrant](misc_vagrant-intro.html):

*   [FreeBSD 9.1 on a budget VPS](misc_freebsd-vm128.html):
    FreeBSD is a great OS - but getting this installed on a KVM VPS with 128MB of RAM wasn't as straightforward as I expected.

    A quick introduction to the critical 'gaming loop' by building a snake clone using JavaScript.

<!-- this needs further editing and should probably live in the misc section!

### Non-technical ###

*   [Singapore vs United Kingdom](misc_sg_vs_uk.html):
    I relocated to Singapore from the UK. How certain things (banking/mobile/transport/...) differ.
*   [Languages](lang_all.html):

*   [Fitness events](misc_fitness-events.html):
    Fitness events I participated in, with some tips for people thinking of joining up.

    Because a colleague asked me and I couldn't give a satisfying answer. Though I'm not sure that one is satisfying either!
