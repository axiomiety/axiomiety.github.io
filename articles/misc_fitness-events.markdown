## JPMorgan Chase Challenge (Q2 2013 - LN) ##

The event took place in Battersea park. The run is mainly tarmac except for a bit of mixed ground at the end.

The biggest difficulty was the sheer number of participants! It's literally elbow to elbow. The race is organised in different waves and the slower your expected time the more people you'll be up against. If you can push forward only it does clear up a bit and does make it a bit more enjoyable.

Note that there are no lockers/bag-drop facilities - so unless you have a team with people staying put, bring as little as possible. Water/bananas are provided at the end of the race (and there are toilet facilities open to all).

## Lion Dash (Q2 2014 - SG) ##

[This event](http://www.liondash.com) took place in Tampines Bike park. In a nutshell it's a cross-country run with various obstacles along the way, including an ice-bath at the end (now that might sound silly in Singapore, but it *is* an ice bath. They top it up with ice-cubes periodically).

Facilities-wise it's really top-notch. Your race pack contains your race tag. Stick it on, stuff everything in your bag and drop it off at the entrance. Staff will stick it in a black bin bag and tag it with your number. You pick it up as is at the end, which is great because you'll be covered in dirt and mud. Make sure you don't lose your tag though!
There are toilets, water stations and a 'wash' station (which is a grand name for a tap in the ground which allows you to rince off your face at the end).

If I had to do it again, I'd suggest the below:
   * Bring a pair of slippers. You trainers will get wet, muddy, and full of sand. You don't want to go home with those.
   * Bring a spare t-shirt. Again, the one you would have worn for the race belongs in the black bin bag you put your belongings in.
   * Get on the early wave - there is congestion at some obstacles, and really at that point you'll just want to reach the finish line as soon as possible. Later waves also mean more heat.

Training-wise:
   * Train in the Singaporean heat and humidity - it's really quite something else.
   * Do cross-country - your ankles are going to take a hit. The terrain is quite rough and you need to watch where you're stepping.
   * Little point in focusing on upper-body strength. It helps, but the vast majority of the race is running.

Quick note - there was little point bringing spectators. About 95% of the race was done in the forest, out of sight. Only the final 3 obstacles were in plain view.

Overall though it's a blast. If you don't mind getting properly dirty (think knee-deep in mud) and want a challenge, go for it.
