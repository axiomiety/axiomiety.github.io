I have lived in a handful of countries but prior to relocating to Singapore I only ever worked in the UK. 

## Banking

Forget free banking - that doesn't quite exist in SG.

### Current account

Current accounts are most commonly known as Savings account. It's important not to get mixed up - there are accounts called 'current' but those usually give you access to things like cheque books and require you to maintain a balance of $3000 so as not to pay a (daily) fee.

### ATMs

To withdraw money for free you need to use the ATM provided by your bank. So if you're a POSB customer you will be charged for withdrawing cash at a UOB ATM. Yep - that sounds weird. But more often than not when there's a bank X ATM, there's a bank Y (and Z) ATM nearby.

## Mobile

Chances are you will be looking for a local SIM - which are available pretty much anywhere from any of the 3 major providers (SingTel, StarHub and M1). There are some pretty important differences you'll want to be aware of (this covers what's called pre-paid in SG, like PAYG in the UK - you can get contracts but can require things like deposits, proof of residential address and generally lock you in for a year or more).


* Tariffs
    There are enough to make your head spin. 
* Incoming calls
    Unless stated otherwise, they are *not* free (and even when described as 'free', it's an extra service that costs $0.X a day and needs to be activated). However when you top up large amounts, some providers give you *actual* free incoming calls as a bonus for a set number of days
* (USSD)
    Ever seen one of those?
    The whole interface to pre-paid services is USSD driven.
* Registration
    You will need to provide your passport when registering. Yes - pre-paid plan require you to register.
* Topping up
    You can buy top-up cards from a number of retails but those offer specific services. So even though you might top up $18, the credit will be used straight away to give you X minutes, Y SMS and Z data. To top up raw credit value (and then use this to the services you actually need, like data), you can top up online or using ATMs/machines. I used a SAM from SingPost - such a handy thing!

### Example



## Public transport

### Taxis

Are much cheaper than their UK counterparts. However note that there are some extra charges you should be aware of - like after midnight the fare will be 50% more expensive. Booking a cab (ie, calling for one to pick you up) is chargeable.

### MRT

MRT is what the Tube could have been had it kept up with times. The Oyster equivalent is called EZ-Link. You can obtain a card from any station for $12 (that's $7 credit and $5 non-refundable for the RFID card). Topping up the card is straight forward and can be done in a variety of places.

If your debit card has the following symbol, you can top it up independently via the machines (it's entirely separate from your bank account).

## Food

Food courts/hawker stores will give you the best value for money. Forget sandwiches, forget pizzas, ...
